# Custom tracker configuration for improved tracking with little similarity

tracker_type: botsort  # Using botsort which has better features for handling challenging tracking scenarios
track_high_thresh: 0.15  # Lower threshold for the first association (default: 0.25)
track_low_thresh: 0.05   # Lower threshold for the second association (default: 0.1)
new_track_thresh: 0.15   # Lower threshold for initializing new tracks (default: 0.25)
track_buffer: 60         # Increased buffer to maintain tracks longer (default: 30)
match_thresh: 0.6        # Lower threshold for matching tracks (default: 0.8)
fuse_score: True         # Fuse confidence scores with IoU distances

# BoT-SORT specific settings
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # Method for global motion compensation
proximity_thresh: 0.3      # Lower IoU threshold for valid match with ReID (default: 0.5)
appearance_thresh: 0.6     # Lower appearance similarity threshold for ReID (default: 0.8)
with_reid: True            # Enable ReID for better tracking with appearance changes
model: auto                # Use native features if detector is YOLO
